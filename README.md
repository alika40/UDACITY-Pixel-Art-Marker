This is "CHALLENGE 2.0" from Udacity on Google for African Scholar Challenge 2018 titled "Lab: Pixel Art Marker".

# INTRO:
Pixel art marker is a web application that offers a user an opporyunity to express themselves through painting.

#FEATURES:
The application has some features like two color panels for canvas background color and grids color that can be toggle between add and remove to add or remove color, a button "CREATE GRID" to create canvas, and another button "CLEAR GRID" to clear or reset the application to the default settings. #NOTE: The "CREATED GRID" button is not functional yet, it's still a work-in-progress. And in the future, more features will be implemented to improve users' experience, and one of such featuers is to add a "SAVE" button that will enable the user to save their paintings.
